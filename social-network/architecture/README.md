# 🏗 Architecture

### Architecture Diagram

> We recommend building architecture using [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/). Draw.io also has a desktop application.

You can also document your architecture using [C4Model](https://c4model.com/). We recommend C1(System Context) and C2(Container) diagrams.

> C4 model is a lean graphical notation technique for modelling the architecture of software systems. It is based on a structural decomposition of a system into containers and components and relies on existing modelling techniques such as the Unified Modelling Language (UML) or Entity Relation Diagrams (ERD) for the more detailed decomposition of the architectural building blocks.
