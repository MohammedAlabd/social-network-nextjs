# ðŸ‘©ðŸ’» Development Process

#### Development Process

The application is developed using modified Feature model. Developers cannot commit to **master** branch. All features are developed in feature branches. A feature can then be merged into master using Pull/merge request.

All branches must be named using the following conventions :

* `feature/issue-{number}` : use for application new features
* `bugfix/issue-{number}` : use for fixing application bugs / issues

examples :

* feature/issue-15469
* bugfix/issue-15469

Developers should follow the following steps :

* Updated the `master` : `git pull origin master`
* create feature branch : `git chekout -b feature/issue-15469`
* Develop the specified requirements
* commit and Push the code
* Raise a Pull request when the code meets [**Checklist**](pr-checklist.md)
* Ask one of the pears for the review
* Address the required review comments
* After the review squash-merge the PR
