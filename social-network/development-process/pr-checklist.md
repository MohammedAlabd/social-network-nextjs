If some of the reviewers take longer than 24 hours, then the creator of the PR is expected to reach out to the reviewers and ask why it's taking them longer than expected and make a decision together on how to move forward. Pull requests should include only changes related to the scope of the PR's purpose Code review comments conventions: These are a couple of flags that we put at the beginning of the comment we leave to say something about the comment
