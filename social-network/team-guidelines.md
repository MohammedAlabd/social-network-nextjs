# üìú Team Guidelines

## Team Guidelines and Expectations

#### **Communication:**

1. Daily Check-ins: Daily check-ins are mandatory for all team members. you should post your check-in everyday before the agreed upon time, even if you didn't do much in that day, make sure to write a check-in message and tell us that
2. Responding to messages that mentions you in it is an important thing to ensure for others that you have seen the message, if the message needs you to write a response you should do so, if not and you just have to read the message, make sure to put a reaction that could tell the rest of the people that you saw and red the message (thumbs up üëç for example)
3. Timely Responses: It is expected that all team members respond to messages within 1 hour during work hours, or by the next morning if they got the message late at night, Leaving messages unanswered for more than 24 hours should be avoided unless there are exceptional circumstances.
4. Over-Communication: We value transparency and collaboration. Always aim to over-communicate rather than under-communicate. It's better to share updates and questions proactively to keep everyone on the same page.
5. Question Documentation: When you encounter challenges or have questions, please write them down along with your attempts to solve them. By explaining your thought process, we can better assist you and promote a learning environment.

#### **Project Timeline:**

The estimated time for completing stage 1 of the project is 2 months. After 2 months, we will conduct a review to assess our progress. Depending on the review outcomes, an additional month may be allocated if needed, after stage 1 a person could decide to leave the bootcamp and we will consider him as successfully finishes stage 1 of the bootcamp, but leaving the bootcamp before that won't give you that recognition, after stage 1 we could start stage 2 of the bootcamp, still not sure how would it look like, but we will figure that out by then

#### **Commitment:**

1. Attendance and Deadlines: Workday absences and missed deadlines should be taken seriously. Always seek permission in advance if you need to miss a workday or a meeting. Requesting permission less than 2 hours before a meeting is not acceptable.
2. Minimum Platform Hours: Each team member should spend at least 3 hours on the platform daily. Consistently failing to meet this minimum requirement for 2 days within a month will be considered a red flag and should be avoided.
